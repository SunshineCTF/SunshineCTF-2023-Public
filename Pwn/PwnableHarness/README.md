# Modified/Hacked versions of [PwnableHarness](https://github.com/C0deH4cker/PwnableHarness)

Due to [this issue](https://github.com/C0deH4cker/PwnableHarness/issues/10), we needed to make two modified versions of PwnableHarness for this CTF: one using Ubuntu 18.04 as the base image and one with Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image. These are in the subdirectories here.
