This is a hacked version of [PwnableHarness](https://github.com/C0deH4cker/PwnableHarness) changed to remove 32-bit support and use Ubuntu 18.04 as the base Docker image for running challenges. See [this issue](https://github.com/C0deH4cker/PwnableHarness/issues/10) for why we couldn't directly use the current version of PwnableHarness and needed to make these changes.
