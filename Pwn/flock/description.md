# Flock of Seagulls

## Ode to Seagulls - Chat GPT
In cyberspace they soar, a flock of seagulls,
Guardians of data, with digital goggles.
Their eyes keen for threats, they scan the waves,
Protecting networks from the darkest caves.

With wings of encryption, they shield the skies,
Defenders of secrets, where danger lies.
In the realm of code, they glide and dive,
Ensuring our data remains alive.

Cyber sentinels, they guard the shore,
Against hackers' storms and breaches galore.
In unity they fly, with vigilance and grace,
These seagulls of security, in cyberspace.
