# Hey! Look at that humungi amongi!

Are you the IMPOSTER??

This game was all the rave back during COVID-19 and now we're bringing it back and better than ever!

An intern wrote this custom implementation of the fan-favorite Among Us, hopefully it's secure ðŸ¤ž

After hearing Among Us Trap Remix all summer, I'm quite sick of this game (and we fired the intern), but being imposter was fun!

Oh, did I mention that the intern is a huge fan of Star Wars? What a nerdddd
