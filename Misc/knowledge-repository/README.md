# Forensics-type scripting challenge
Deploy the challenge with the attachment `greetings_human.zip` and `description.md`.

Test with the `solve_script.sh` in `how_its_made` if the challenge is broken (presumes linux of course). Should produce the flag in flag.txt.

## Standard hint
If you're new to this, `file`, `CyberChef`, and good-ol bash-for-loops will be handy here. No hearing ability is necessary to solve this challenge.
