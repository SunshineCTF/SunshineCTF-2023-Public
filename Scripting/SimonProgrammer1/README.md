# [Scripting] SimonProgrammer 1

This is a *very basic* challenge that is very similar to the robots challenge.

The difference is this one is a simon-says type game that modifies the sequence on each user's session.

## Deploying

This is deployed like any other WSGI Flask challenge. Docker should do the trick!

## Solution

A solver script, `solve.py`, is included that solves this in Python:

```sh
python3 solve.py
```

* Thanks to [aubio](https://github.com/aubio/aubio) who have an awesome sound library and tooling that I used to solve Programmer 3.
