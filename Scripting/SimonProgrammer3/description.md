## Music to my ears!

...

Really?

You solved it that way?

Why?

I mean, the old way was broken, so I guess it makes sense, but...

It's so much easier to just solve it with the right tools!

Ok ok, this time, I give you a working challenge.

And don't try to solve it manually! I have a ticking clock this time, so you better solve these fast!

As Mr. Schmitt says, there are a whole lot of techniques to answer back with a pitch, but his is the best!

WAIT... NOOOOOO ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–

*robots have taken over this challenge*

*Visit `https://simon-now-you-c-me-now-you-dont.2023.sunshinectf.org:5002`, if you dare, human!*

But don't worry that this game will get old! The flags in this game are split into three octaves, with one flag in each... you'll never find them all! And since it's random, no two games will ever be alike!

Flag will be given by our backend in the standard `sun{}` format!

## Notes

We are not unreasonable.

All we ask is you listen to the music with 99.9% accuracy.

Should be easy for you, *human*.
